### Hi, I'm Satyam ðŸ‘‹  

#### About Me  
Hi there! Iâ€™m Satyam, a penultimate-year Engineering Science student at the University of Oxford, passionate about solving complex challenges with code. Whether itâ€™s designing smarter systems, diving into data-driven projects, or building intuitive web solutions, I enjoy working on ideas that push boundaries and make an impact.  

Outside the world of code, Iâ€™m often on the river as a cox, steering rowing boats and making real-time decisions to help my crew perform their best. Iâ€™m also an experienced debater, which has taught me how to communicate effectively, think critically, and adapt quicklyâ€”skills I carry into my technical work.  

#### Skills  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, MATLAB, P4, C#, C++  
- **Technical Tools:** Linux, Git workflows  
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database Management:** SQL, MS Access  
- **Communication:** Fluent in English and Hindi, with extensive experience in debating and public speaking  

#### Projects  
Check out my repositories for projects that explore machine learning, full-stack development, and algorithm design. Each project reflects my curiosity and determination to tackle diverse challenges.  

#### Letâ€™s Connect  
If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, discussing an idea, or just geeking out about tech (or rowing!), feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to connect!
